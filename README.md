# attack-scripts

This repository is intended to provide a library of functions to improve users' interactions with ATT&CK content. In addition, it will provide one-off scripts
for processing and visualizing ATT&CK content — See [the scripts folder](scripts) for more details. 

Note: this repository is a work in progress. In the coming months we will be adding additional functionalities as well as soliciting scripts from ATT&CK users — see [contributing to attack-scripts](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation
1. Create a new virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the environment: `source env/bin/activate`
3. Install requirements into the virtual environment: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Related MITRE Work
#### CTI
[Cyber Threat Intelligence repository](https://github.com/mitre/cti) of the ATT&CK catalog expressed in STIX 2.0 JSON.

#### ATT&CK
ATT&CK<sup>™</sup> is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risk against known adversary behavior, for planning security improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected.

#### STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX<sup>™</sup>) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.

STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
